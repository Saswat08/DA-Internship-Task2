### Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into the performance and efficiency of a call center. It visualizes key metrics such as call response rates, resolution rates, average customer satisfaction, and agent performance over a specific period.

The dataset used for this project contains detailed records of call center operations, which include metrics on answered calls, resolved issues, speed of response, and customer satisfaction scores.

2. Average Satisfaction: A gauge visualization shows the average satisfaction rating of the calls.
   
3. Call Performance by Month: Bar charts highlight the number of calls received each month and whether they were answered or not.
   
4. Agent Performance: A tabular report that tracks the number of calls handled by each agent, the number of issues resolved, their average customer satisfaction scores, and the average speed of response.
